# Indy SDK for Node.js

Native bindings for hyperledger indy.

*Work-In-Progress* currently only linux is supported.

## How to contribute to this wrapper

Setup an Indy SDK environment, and start the local nodes.
 * [ubuntu](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/ubuntu-build.md)

Then build
```sh
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

That will watch for file changes and automatically re-build then run tests.
