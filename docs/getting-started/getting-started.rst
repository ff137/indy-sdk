Getting Started with Indy-SDK
=============================

Welcome to the Indy SDK! This is the best place to be introduced to the Indy ecosystem. 
If you are looking to first understand how Indy SDK can be used to implement self-sovereign identity and verifiable credentials,
first check out the video of a demo created by IBM:

Next, if you would like to understand more about the foundational conceptions of self-sovereign identity (SSI) please take a look at this webinar
that explains it more in depth: `SSI Meetup Webinar <https://youtu.be/RllH91rcFdE?t=4m30s>`_

To begin writing code, we recommend running the :doc:`Getting Started Guide with Docker <run-getting-started>`

If you'd like a more thorough technical walkthrough of SSI using Indy, take a look at the :doc:`Indy Story Walkthrough <indy-walkthrough>` that we've written. 

Once you've looked through these guides, we recommend looking around the `SDK Wrappers (Github folder) <https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/wrappers>`_ to understand the SDK, 
and then using the :doc:`How-to Guides <../how-tos/README.md>` we've created to accomplish what you'd like to do.
