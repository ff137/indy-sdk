libindy (1.5.0) unstable; urgency=medium

[ Hyperledger ]

* Integrated tags based search in Anoncreds workflow:
    * Updated `indy_prover_store_credential` API function to create tags for a stored credential object.
    * API functions `indy_prover_get_credentials` and `indy_prover_get_credentials_for_proof_req` marked as `Deprecated`.
    * Added two chains of APIs related to credentials search that allows fetching records by batches:
        * Simple credentials search - `indy_prover_search_credentials`
        * Search credentials for proof request - `indy_prover_search_credentials_for_proof_req`
    * Supported [WQL query language](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/doc/design/011-wallet-query-language) for all search functions in Anoncreds API.
* Added `indy_prover_get_credential` API function allows to get human-readable credential by the specific id from Wallet.
* Performed changes related to Libindy Wallet behavior:
    * Changed Wallet export serialization format to use the same message pack as the rest of LibIndy.
    * Removed association between Wallet and Pool.
    * Removed persistence of Wallet configuration by Libindy.
    * Updated `wallet_create`, `wallet_open`, `wallet_delete` functions to accept wallet configuration as a single JSON.
* Performed changes related to Libindy [Pool behavior](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/doc/design/009-efficient-connections):
    * Changed Pool connection logic to avoid unnecessary opened connections.
    * Changed Catch-up process to get all transactions from a single node.
    * Implemented logic of persisting of actual Pool Leger at the end of catch-up process and starting from this point on the next time.
* Performed changes related to Libindy Payment API. The main idea of these changes is avoiding UTXO based payments and supporting non-UTXO based crypto payments and traditional payments like VISA.
* Removed EXPERIMENTAL notice from Libindy Payment API.
* Bugfixes

Notes:

* There is [migration guide](doc/migration-guide-1.5.0-1.6.0.md) about API changes.
